# Face Mask example

## What is it?

It's android example of Android application with Augmeneted Reality effects on face.
This application uses VrFace library on Android.
This project shows you how easily VrFace library could be used.

## How it works?

It uses my submodule [VrFace](https://github.com/oleg-sta/VrFace) with all description of logic in it.
Just add dependency: .. TODO
and add effects using glsl and 3d models.

You could just fork it or clone it and add your own effect, you could try to add this library in your application for the effects.
